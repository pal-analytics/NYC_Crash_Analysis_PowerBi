Traffic Safety Risk Analysis (NYC | 2012–2025)

## Business Problem

New York City records a high volume of traffic collisions, but risk is not evenly distributed by time, location, or cause. This project identifies when, where, and why collisions become most severe to support targeted safety interventions.

## What Was Analyzed

- Collision trends over time (2012–2025)
- Risk by borough, time of day, and vehicle type
- Injury severity vs collision volume
- Key contributing factors driving fatalities
- Time-based risk using custom Time Buckets (Morning, Midday, Evening, Night)

## Key Insights

- Night-time crashes show the highest fatality risk, despite lower volume.
- Driver inattention is the leading contributor; poor reporting inflates “Unknown” causes.
- Brooklyn and Queens show higher severity per collision than Manhattan.
- High collision volume does not always mean highest risk.
- Sedans and station wagons account for the majority of collisions.

## Business Impact

- Prioritize severity-based safety funding, not just volume.
- Target night-time enforcement (fatigue, DUI, lighting).
- Improve reporting quality to reduce “Unknown” contributing factors.
- Apply borough-specific safety measures instead of city-wide policies.
