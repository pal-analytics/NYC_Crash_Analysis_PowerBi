NYC Crash Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

Designed by Pallavi Mali

This project analyzes 10M+ motor vehicle collisions in NYC (2012–2025) using Power BI. It highlights accident trends, injuries, fatalities, contributing factors, vehicle involvement, and high-risk locations.

> Key Objectives
- Identify annual, hourly, and monthly crash patterns
- Pinpoint high-risk boroughs, streets, and zones
- Examine major causes and contributing factors
- Analyze vehicle types most frequently involved
- Provide data-driven insights for public safety & traffic improvement

> Dashboard Pages
- Page 1 – Collision Overview: KPIs, borough distribution, top streets, yearly trends
- Page 2 – When Crashes Happen: Hourly, weekday vs weekend, seasonal injury/fatality peaks
- Page 3 – Why Crashes Happen: Contributing factors, vehicle type breakdown, street-level injuries

> Key Insights
- Weekdays account for ~7M crashes (74%)
- Summer months show peak injuries & fatalities
- Sedans & SUVs involved in ~80% of incidents
- Data quality gaps: 3.1M records with “Unknown” borough/street, 6M crashes with “Unknown” cause
